# Highlight
An extension that saves your place in the page.   
**Note:** This is the Firefox version. For the Chrome version, see the [main](https://github.com/barhatsor/smart-bookmark/tree/main) branch.

## About
Designed for reading long articles or highlighting a specific passage.  
Click it and it'll make a bookmark that saves where you were!  
If someone else has the extension, just share the bookmark with them, it'll work.

Works by saving your scroll position in the [fragment identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_fragment) (hashcode) of the bookmark URL and scrolling to it.
