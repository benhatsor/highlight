# Highlight
An extension that saves your place in the page. [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/highlight/lokgbeagjjdgpdfcgbafajfgbjiocjod) - [Firefox Addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/highlightapp)

## About 
Designed for reading long articles or highlighting a specific passage.  
Click it and it'll make a bookmark that saves where you were!  
If someone else has the extension, just share the bookmark with them, it'll work.

Works by saving your scroll position in the [fragment identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_fragment) (hashcode) of the bookmark URL and scrolling to it.
